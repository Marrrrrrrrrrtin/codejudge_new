The function correctly implements the required functionality by using the formula \\(\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\) and returns the calculated area.\n\n4.

This is incorrect because an even number can still be the sum of four even numbers (e.g., 8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2).\n   - If `n` is odd, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n/2`.

Issues:\n   - The check `if n % 2 == 0: return False` is incorrect and does not align with the problem requirements.\n   - The loop logic is incorrect for checking if `n` can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers.

The problem statement requires a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list sorted in a \"strange\" order, which alternates between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers.\n2. The provided code snippet starts by sorting the input list in ascending order. It then initializes an empty list called `new_list` to store the sorted list in the strange order. The code iterates through the sorted list using a for loop. For each element in the list, it checks if the length of the list is odd or even. If the list length is odd, and the current index is 0, it adds the first element (minimum value) to `new_list`. If the index is not 0, it adds the last element (maximum value) to `new_list`. The same logic is applied when the list length is even. Finally, the function returns the `new_list`.\n3. The code snippet does not correctly alternate between the minimum and maximum values of the remaining integers. It does not remove the elements from the original list after adding them to `new_list`, so the maximum value is always the last element of the sorted list, and the minimum value remains the first element.
