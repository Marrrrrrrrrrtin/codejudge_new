The problem statement requires a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all prefixes of the string, starting from the shortest to the longest.\n2. The code snippet defines a function `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input. It initializes an empty list `prefixes` to store the prefixes. It then iterates over the range of the length of the string, and for each index `i`, it appends the substring from the start of the string to the index `i+1` to the `prefixes` list. Finally, it returns the `prefixes` list.\n3. The code snippet correctly implements the required functionality of the problem statement. It generates all prefixes of the input string and returns them in the correct order.\n\nConclusion: The code snippet fully covers the required functionalities of the problem statement.",

The result should be an array of these differences for all matches.\n2. The code snippet defines a function `compare` that takes two arrays, `game` (representing the actual scores) and `guess` (representing the guessed scores). It initializes an empty list `result` to store the differences. The function then iterates over the indices of the arrays, comparing the actual score and the guess at each index.

The provided code snippet defines a function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the numbers that have already been encountered and an empty list `result` to store the numbers that occur only once. It then iterates over the input list, and for each number, it checks if the number is not in the `seen` set. If the number is not in the set, it adds the number to the set and appends it to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list. \n3. The code snippet correctly implements the required functionality by maintaining the order of elements and removing duplicates. Therefore, the code snippet covers all the required functionalities of the problem statement.",

A list is monotonically increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one, and monotonically decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous one.

The provided code snippet defines a function monotonic that takes a list l as input. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, the function returns True because a list with fewer than two elements is trivially monotonically increasing and decreasing. The function then checks if the first and last elements of the list are equal. If they are, the function returns True because a list with all equal elements is both monotonically increasing and decreasing. If the first element of the list is less than the last element, the function checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. If they are, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False. If the first element of the list is greater than the last element, the function checks if all elements in the list are greater than or equal to the next element.
