The code then calculates the sum of the array and multiplies it by the product of the signs of each number. However, the implementation of the sign calculation is incorrect. The lambda function used in the `map` function does not correctly calculate the product of the signs. It returns 1 for positive numbers, -1 for negative numbers, and 0 for zero. The product of the signs should be calculated as 1 for an array with all positive or all negative numbers, -1 for an array with an odd number of negative numbers, and 0 for an array with a zero.\n4.

The code snippet defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements.\n3. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the indices of the input list and computes the maximum of the sublist from the start up to the current index.\n4. The comprehension `[max(numbers[:i+1]) for i in range(len(numbers))]` correctly computes the rolling maximum by slicing the list from the start to the current index and finding the maximum value.\n5. The function returns the expected output for the given example.\n\nConclusion: The code snippet correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.",

Here's a breakdown of the issues:\n\n1. **Identifying Consonants**: The problem requires counting consonants, but the code checks for lowercase letters instead. Consonants are all alphabetic characters that are not vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), and this check should be case-insensitive.\n\n2. **Splitting Words**: The code manually splits words by checking for spaces, which is not incorrect but can be simplified using Python's built-in string methods.\n\n3. **Counting Consonants**: The code incorrectly counts lowercase letters instead of consonants. It should count letters that are not vowels.\n\n4. **Appending Words**: The code appends words to the list when the count matches `n`, but it does so without checking if the last character was a space, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the string ends with a word that matches the criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, the code snippet does not correctly implement the problem statement. It does not accurately count consonants and does not handle the input and output as specified.",

A right-angled triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n2. **Code Snippet**: The function `right_angle_triangle(a, b, c)` checks for the condition of a right-angled triangle by evaluating:\n   - \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\n   - \\(b^2 + c^2 = a^2\\)\n   - \\(a^2 + c^2 = b^2\\)\n   If any of these conditions are true, it returns `True`, indicating that the sides form a right-angled triangle.
